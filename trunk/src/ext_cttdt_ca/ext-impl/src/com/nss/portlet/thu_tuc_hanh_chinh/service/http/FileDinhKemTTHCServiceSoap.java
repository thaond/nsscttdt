 * This class provides a SOAP utility for the
 * <code>com.nss.portlet.thu_tuc_hanh_chinh.service.FileDinhKemTTHCServiceUtil</code> service
 * utility. The static methods of this class calls the same methods of the
 * service utility. However, the signatures are different because it is
 * difficult for SOAP to support certain types.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * ServiceBuilder follows certain rules in translating the methods. For example,
 * if the method in the service utility returns a <code>java.util.List</code>,
 * that is translated to an array of
 * <code>com.nss.portlet.thu_tuc_hanh_chinh.model.FileDinhKemTTHCSoap</code>. If the method in the
 * service utility returns a <code>com.nss.portlet.thu_tuc_hanh_chinh.model.FileDinhKemTTHC</code>,
 * that is translated to a <code>com.nss.portlet.thu_tuc_hanh_chinh.model.FileDinhKemTTHCSoap</code>.
 * Methods that SOAP cannot safely wire are skipped.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The benefits of using the SOAP utility is that it is cross platform
 * compatible. SOAP allows different languages like Java, .NET, C++, PHP, and
 * even Perl, to call the generated services. One drawback of SOAP is that it is
 * slow because it needs to serialize all calls into a text format (XML).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can see a list of services at
 * http://localhost:8080/tunnel-web/secure/axis. Set the property
 * <code>tunnel.servlet.hosts.allowed</code> in portal.properties to configure
 * security.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The SOAP utility is only generated for remote services.
